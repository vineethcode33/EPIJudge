##### Binary Tree

- Each node, except the root is itself the root fo a left subtree or aright subtree.
- Exception of the root every node has a unique parent.
- search path is the unique sequence of node from root node to the idividual node we are searching for.
- A node is an ancestor and decendant of itself.
- Node that has no decendant is called leaf
- **Depth** of node is the number of nodes from root in search path to itself not including the search target node itself.
- **Height** of a binary tree is max depth.
- **Level** of a tree is all nodes at the same depth.
- **Full binary tree** is a binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
- **Prefect binary tree** is a binary tree in which all leaves are at the same depth and in which every parent has two children.
